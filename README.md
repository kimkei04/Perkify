what needs changing/add/delete:

1. improve the subscription plan on the business UI. (specifically making sure that when the plan is chosen, features will change according to that plan)
2. add backend and connect to database:
    - so that costumer files can be edited, remoed and edited, profile can be changed/edited in both consumer and business profile, make some buttons work (ex: notif button), etc..
3. improvemtns in the logo and on the index.
